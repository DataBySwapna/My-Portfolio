# Swapna Macha - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Swapna! I am an aspiring data analyst with a solid educational background in computer science and a recent certification from the Google Data Analytics Professional program. My interest in data analytics developed during my teaching role, where managing and analysing student data allowed me to see the potential of using data to drive meaningful decisions. 

I am currently completing a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with Just IT training. Through this program, I have gained practical experience in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to transform raw data into actionable insights. I have completed projects utilizing tools such as Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Python, working with diverse datasets.

I am determined to establish myself in the data analytics domain, combining my education in computer science with the technical expertise and skills acquired through my training and certifications. I am seeking opportunities to contribute to data-driven decision-making while addressing challenges and delivering impactful solutions.

My CV in TBD.

This is a repository for showcasing my skills, sharing projects, and tracking my progress in Data Analytics and data Science topics.
